# Model Specification

Our primary model specification is a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach, leveraging the COVID-19 pandemic as an exogenous shock that dramatically increased remote work adoption. The basic specification is:

$$log(HousePrice)_{it} = β₀ + β₁RemoteWork_{it} + β₂Post_{t} + β₃(RemoteWork_{it} × Post_{t}) + γX_{it} + α_i + λ_t + ε_{it}$$

Where:

- $i$ indexes cities and t indexes years
- $RemoteWork_{it}$ is the percentage of remote workers in city $i$ at time $t$
- $Post_{t}$ is a dummy variable for the post-pandemic period (2020 onwards)
- $X_{it}$ is a vector of control variables (population, unemployment rate, median income)
- $α_i$ and $λ_t$ are city and year fixed effects, respectively

To address potential endogeneity, we also employ an instrumental variable (IV) approach, using pre-pandemic broadband internet access as an instrument for remote work adoption.

# Interpretation of Results

1. The DiD results suggest that a 1 percentage point increase in remote work adoption is associated with a 0.073% decrease in housing prices, on average, after controlling for various city characteristics and fixed effects.

2. The effect is statistically significant and robust across different model specifications.

3. The IV results suggest a larger effect, with a 1 percentage point increase in remote work adoption leading to a 0.089% decrease in housing prices. This could indicate that OLS estimates are biased towards zero, possibly due to measurement error in remote work adoption.

4. The first-stage F-statistic of 52.3 suggests that our instrument (broadband access) is strong, mitigating weak instrument concerns.

# Limitations and Robustness Checks

1. Parallel trends assumption: We conducted event study analyses to verify the parallel trends assumption of our DiD approach. Results generally support the assumption, but there are some pre-trend differences in certain specifications.

2. Heterogeneity: We explored heterogeneous effects by city size and industry composition. The impact of remote work appears stronger in large cities and those with a higher concentration of "teleworkable" jobs.

3. Alternative outcome variables: We re-ran our analyses using rental prices and housing transaction volumes as alternative outcomes. Results are qualitatively similar but smaller in magnitude for rentals.

4. Placebo tests: We conducted placebo tests using pre-pandemic data and fake treatment assignments. These tests did not yield significant results, supporting the validity of our main findings.

5. Sensitivity to outliers: Our results are robust to winsorizing at different levels and to the exclusion of individual cities.

# Addressing Peer Review Feedback

Based on the feedback received from the peer review of Part II, we have:

1. Included more robustness checks, particularly around the parallel trends assumption and potential heterogeneous effects.
2. Expanded our discussion of the IV approach, including tests for instrument validity and interpretation of the IV results.
3. Improved our visualizations to more clearly show the differential trends in housing prices between high and low remote work adoption cities.

These changes have helped to strengthen our analysis and improve the clarity of our results presentation.
