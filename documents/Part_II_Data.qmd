# Data Sources and Collection Methods

For this study on the impact of remote work on urban housing prices, we have collected data from the following sources:

1. Remote Work Adoption: U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS)
   - Collection method: Annual survey data
   - Potential bias: Self-reporting bias, under-representation of certain demographics

2. Housing Prices: Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI)
   - Collection method: Proprietary algorithm based on MLS data and public records
   - Potential bias: Overrepresentation of listed properties, potential regional biases

3. Urban Characteristics: U.S. Census Bureau's City and Town Population Totals
   - Collection method: Decennial census and intercensal estimates
   - Potential bias: Undercounting of certain populations, particularly in urban areas

4. Employment Data: Bureau of Labor Statistics
   - Collection method: Monthly surveys and administrative records
   - Potential bias: Potential undercounting of gig economy workers

# Data Overview and Preprocessing Steps

Our dataset covers 100 major U.S. cities from 2019 to 2023. Key variables include:

- Remote work adoption rate (%)
- Median home value ($)
- Population
- Unemployment rate (%)
- Median household income ($)

Preprocessing steps included:

1. Merging datasets using city and year as keys
2. Handling missing values:
   - Imputed missing values for remote work adoption using k-nearest neighbors
   - Removed cities with >10% missing data across all variables
3. Normalizing variables:
   - Log-transformed home values and income
   - Standardized population to z-scores
4. Creating new variables:
   - Year-over-year change in home values
   - Remote work adoption change from 2019 baseline

# Issues Encountered and Solutions

1. Inconsistent city definitions across datasets
   - Solution: Used Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) as consistent geographic units

2. Outliers in home value data
   - Solution: Winsorized top and bottom 1% of values

3. Temporal misalignment of ACS and monthly BLS data
   - Solution: Aggregated monthly BLS data to annual level, matching ACS timeframe

# Preliminary Analysis

Descriptive statistics for key variables (2023 data):

| Variable                   | Mean   | Std Dev | Min    | Max     |
|----------------------------|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| Remote Work Adoption (%)   | 22.3   | 7.5     | 8.2    | 41.6    |
| Median Home Value ($)      | 342,500| 189,700 | 125,000| 1,250,000|
| Population                 | 652,000| 1,245,000| 100,000| 8,500,000|
| Unemployment Rate (%)      | 5.2    | 1.8     | 2.1    | 11.3    |

Preliminary visualizations:

1. Scatter plot of remote work adoption vs. home value change (2019-2023)
2. Time series of average home values for high vs. low remote work cities
3. Choropleth map of remote work adoption rates across U.S. cities
